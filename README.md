# 2017 Content Developer for PythonTA

## Week 1 (May 22 - May 28)

### Install PyTA

- Everything works after cloning the repository and running `pip install -e .`.
- Maybe replace `>>> python_ta.doc('E9999')` with `>>> python_ta.doc('E9998')` in the README, so that it coincides with the error given by `>>> python_ta.check_all('examples.forbidden_import_example')`?

### Configure pylint

- Installed and configured pylint locally to make sure that I can reproduce all the errors.
- [linter-pylint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-pylint) plugin for Atom produces tooltips describing an error and giving a link to more complete documentation. Not sure how much work it would be to adopt this to PyCharm and PyTA, but it could be very useful for students.
  - For example, the `examples/pylint/E0211_no_method_argument.py` file produces the following:

  - `E0211` link icon points to: http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:e0211.

### Website

- Created a list of errors which can be produced by pylint but are not covered in '.pylintrc' or 'index.md': see [missing_error_codes.ipynb](notebooks/missing_error_codes.ipynb).
- Should the errors be described in any particular order?

### PyTA

- Created a notebook with output generated by python_ta for all files in the "pyta/examples" directory: see [missing_error_codes.ipynb](notebooks/missing_error_codes.ipynb).
- Need to hide output for some errors and look at this much more in-depth.

Some problems that were discovered:
- `E9997 (forbidden-global-variables)`
  - This error is very easy to trigger and calls all sorts of functions and builtins (`range`, `function`, `print`) as variables.
  - Produces duplicate messages, highlighting a variable both when it is declared and used.

### Pull request structure

- I guess it does not make sense to have one pull request for each error?
